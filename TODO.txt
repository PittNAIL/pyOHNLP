TODO:
Implement capability to read and write from DB
Read and write from folder (file system)
Read and write from .zip files
Keep in mind it may not be a total match.. allow for the ability to go for instance:
READ FROM .ZIP WRITE TO DATABASE
READ FROM .ZIP WRITE TO .CSV

reading .zip should be done 'in stream' without extracting the .zip file into temporary folder if
possible.

Need metrics for
> cpu
> ram
> time
> accuracy

Clean up the ConTextRules to be more representative of desired outputs.
Need to create a mapping for:
Experiencer (is it the patient, a family member, other)
Certainty (is it positive, definitely not, possible, hypothetical)
Temporality (is it a present condition? in family history? in patient history?)
